Cloud provider runs your code only when needed, managing servers behind the scenes. You only pay for execution time.

## Characteristics

- Event-driven (triggered by actions like file upload, HTTP request, or database change).
- Fully managed infrastructure — no OS or server maintenance.

## Advantages

- Zero idle cost.
- Automatically scales with demand.
- No server maintenance work.

## Limitations

- Cold starts may slow down infrequently used functions.
- Limited execution time and resources.
- Not suited for constantly running workloads.
