Key metrics used for monitoring servers:

- **CPU usage** — measures processing load.
- **Memory usage** — shows how much RAM is in use.
- **Request throughput (req/sec)** — how many requests are handled per second.
- **Response time / latency** — how fast the server replies.
- **Error rates** — percentage of failed requests.
