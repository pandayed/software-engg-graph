Programming languages are formal languages used to write instructions that can be executed by a computer.

## Types

- **Compiled languages**: Converted to machine code before execution (e.g., C, Go, Rust).
- **Interpreted languages**: Executed line by line at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- **Hybrid**: Use both compilation and interpretation (e.g., Java, C#).

## Paradigms

- **Procedural**: Step-by-step instructions (C, Pascal).
- **Object-Oriented**: Organized around objects and classes (Java, C++).
- **Functional**: Focuses on pure functions and immutability (Haskell, Erlang).
- **Multi-paradigm**: Supports multiple paradigms (Python, JavaScript, Go).
