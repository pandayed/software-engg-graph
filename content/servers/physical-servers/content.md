A real, tangible machine dedicated entirely to running your server software. You own or lease it and control both hardware and software.

Used by banks and other high-security service providers primarily for **regulatory compliance** and **data protection**. In many cases, sensitive information—such as financial records—is legally required to stay within specific **geographical or physical boundaries**. Storing such data on servers located in another country is often prohibited. On-premises infrastructure ensures complete control over **where** the data resides and **who** can physically access it, reducing the risk of unauthorized entry or tampering that could compromise security.

## Characteristics

- Located on-premises or in a colocation data center.
- Requires dedicated IT staff for setup, monitoring, and maintenance.
- Not easily scalable without buying and setting up new hardware.

## Advantages

- Full control over hardware and software configuration.
- Maximum performance because no resources are shared.
- Meets strict compliance/security requirements.

## Limitations

- High upfront and maintenance costs.
- Scaling requires physical upgrades.
- Slower to deploy compared to cloud solutions.
