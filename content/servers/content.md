A **server** is a machine that **listens for requests** from clients and **processes them** to send back a response.

---

In order for a machine to be server, some code is *deployed* on the machine.

Deployment means configuring the application specific environment and running the application, which involves (not necessarily always):

- Installing necessary software/libraries
- Configuring security (firewalls, user permissions)
- Setting up databases or other dependencies
- Copying, installing and starting the application code

Installing the OS, and doing basic configuration like internet connectivity are part of provisioning or setup and not deployment.
