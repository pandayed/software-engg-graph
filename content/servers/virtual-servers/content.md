In simpler terms, one large hardware, running multiple OS. Each application manager gets and (usually) manages their own OS.

## Characteristics

- Hosted on-premises or in the cloud.
- Easier to scale than physical servers.
- Shares physical resources with other virtual servers.

## Advantages

- No need to purchase dedicated hardware.
- Quick to deploy and adjust resources.
- Can run different OS types on the same physical machine.

## Limitations

- Performance can vary if other virtual machines consume resources.
- You still manage the OS and updates.
